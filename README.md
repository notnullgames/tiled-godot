# tiled demo

This is a demo project for godot, that uses [tiled-to-godot-export](https://github.com/MikeMnD/tiled-to-godot-export).

You can see it running [here](https://tile-godot.surge.sh/).

I am currently testing with [feature7](https://github.com/konsumer/tiled-to-godot-export/tree/feature-7), ensuring that export works without `projectRoot`.
